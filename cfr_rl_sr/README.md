# Prerequisites

- Install prerequisites (test with Ubuntu 20.04, Python 3.8.5, Tensorflow v2.2.0, PuLP 2.3, networkx 2.5, tqdm 4.51.0)

```
python3 setup.py
```

# Training

- To train a policy for a topology, put the topology file (e.g., Abilene) and the traffic matrix file (e.g., AbileneTM)
  in `data/`, then specify the file name in config.py, i.e., topology_file = 'Abilene' and traffic_file = 'TM', and then
  run

```
python3 train.py
```

- Please refer to `data/Abilene` for more details about topology file format.
- In a traffic matrix file, each line belongs to a N*N traffic matrix, where N is the node number of a topology.
- Please refer to `config.py` for more details about configurations.

# Testing

- To test the trained policy on a set of test traffic matrices, put the test traffic matrix file (e.g., AbileneTM2)
  in `data/`, then specify the file name in config.py, i.e., test_traffic_file = 'TM2', and then run

```
python3 test.py
```
